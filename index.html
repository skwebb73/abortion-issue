				<h2>North Carolina Criminalizes Abortion</h2>
				<em>1881</em>
				<p>
					North Carolina criminalized abortion and the concealing of birth of a child. It became a felony for people to administer procedures to induce an abortion. This law was cited in the 2022 Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="30/08/2017">
				<h2>Health risk exception</h2>
				<em>1967</em>
				<p>
					The N.C. General Assembly added a provision that doctors in a hospital may perform abortion procedures if there is a substantial health risk to the life of the pregnant person or if the child would be burn with a serious physical or mental defect. Doctors may also perform abortions for pregnancies that resulted in rape if the rape was reported to law enforcement agencies within seven days. Three doctors would have to then examine the pregnant person and certify in writing that they believe the abortion is justified.
				</p>

			</li>

			<li data-date="20/11/2017">
				<h2>Roe v. Wade</h2>
				<em>1973</em>
				<p>
					o	In January 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision on Roe v. Wade guarantees an individual’s right to abortion. A few months later in May 1973, North Carolina outlines that abortion is no longer unlawful if performed during the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy. If there is substantial risk to the pregnant person, an abortion may be performed by a licensed physician.

				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="10/02/2018">
				<h2>State abortion fund</h2>
				<em>1978</em>
				<p>
					The state abortion fund was established to aid low-income individuals in paying for abortion services. Later laws in 1995 made the fund effectively unusable with an increase in restrictions, and in 2006 the fund got repealed.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="09/08/2018">
				<h2>Parental consent required</h2>
				<em>1995</em>
				<p>
					Parental consent is not required for abortion care, except in medical abortions. It became a Class 1 misdemeanor for a doctor to perform an abortion on a minor without parental consent.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="01/02/2019">
				<h2>Restrictions to access</h2>
				<em>2011</em>
				<p>
					The “Woman’s Right to Know Act” restricts abortion access in the state by enacting a mandatory 24-hour waiting period, state-mandated counseling, and forced ultrasounds in which the patient must view the ultrasound images. The ultrasound requirement was later struck down in Stuart v. Huff the same year.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="01/03/2019">
				<h2>More legislation restricts access</h2>
				<em>2013</em>
				<p>
					The NC General Assembly continued to make it harder for people to access abortions. It passed new requirements that made it harder for women’s health centers to stay open and prohibited Affordable Care Act health insurance from going towards abortion coverage except in rare cases of rape, incest, or risk of life.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="01/04/2019">
				<h2>Women and Children Protection Act</h2>
				<em>2015</em>
				<p>
					This act increased the waiting period for abortions from 24 hours to 72 hours. It also required the NC Department of Health and Human Services to collect medical and demographic records on abortions.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="30/05/2019">
				<h2>20-week ban ruled unlawful</h2>
				<em>2019</em>
				<p>
					The federal district court declared the 20-week ban unlawful and extended abortion access up to viability. Upon the overturning of Roe v. Wade, this injunction was overturned.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li data-date="29/06/2019">
				<h2>Roe v. Wade overturned, N.C. restricts access</h2>
				<em>2022</em>
				<p>
					On June 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively ending federal protections to the right of abortion. Later in August, a U.S. District Court reinstated the 20-week ban on abortion in North Carolina, except for exceptions for medical emergencies.
